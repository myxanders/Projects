# Capping Project - ACME Coprorate Directory

This project required my team and I to:
- Create a portal for ACME employees
- Create a directory to look up employees of the company and their information
- Allow different accounts different privileges (Manager, HR, Admin, employee)
- Handle application access
- Create profile pages
- Store information securely in a database

Amongst other smaller requirements.
This worked as our equivalent of a Senior Thesis or Final Practical.

Team Members: Mitchell Xanders, Reynaldo Alvarez, Kai Mannaseh, Erina Caferra, Liz Sanchez
