# This was a project done in Software Development II during the Fall Semester of 2015. The goal of the projects was to create
# a form for students to enter information and select appropriate on-campus housing based on their information entered.
# Results were tracked in a table in localhost/phpmyadmin.
# These files were written to be run via XAMPP. The project was also completed for use via cloud9 server.
